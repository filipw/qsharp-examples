    "# Certified Randomness Amplification\n",
    "## Dynamically Probing Remote Random Quantum States\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a protocol to generate high-quality random numbers using a quantum computer, based on the paper [Certified randomness amplification by dynamically probing remote random quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03686), Liu et al, arXiv:2511.03686, 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol ensures that the randomness generated by a remote quantum device is genuine and not produced by a classical simulation or a pre-determined sequence. It relies on the computational hardness of simulating random quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Challenge Generation**<br/>\n",
    "The client generates a random quantum circuit. The circuit consists of layers of random single-qubit gates and fixed two-qubit entangling gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Gate Streaming & Delayed Measurement**<br/>\n",
    "The client streams the single-qubit gates to the server. Crucially, the measurement basis for the final layer is revealed only at the very last moment. This minimizes the time available for a malicious server to perform a classical simulation (spoofing).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Sampling**<br/>\n",
    "The quantum server executes the circuit and returns a bitstring sample within a strict time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Verification**<br/>\n",
    "The client verifies the randomness by computing the **Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmarking (XEB)** score. A high XEB score certifies that the samples were likely generated by a quantum process and are therefore unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Amplification (Conceptual)**<br/>\n",
    "In the full protocol, the certified quantum randomness is combined with a weak random source using a randomness extractor to produce nearly perfect randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Structure\n",
    "The circuits used in this protocol are constructed as follows:\n",
    "- Initial State: $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$\n",
    "- Layers: Alternating layers of random single-qubit gates and fixed two-qubit gates (Rzz).\n",
    "- Single-Qubit Gates: Drawn from the set $\\{ Z^p X^{1/2} Z^{-p} \\}$ where $p \\in \\{-1, -3/4, \\dots, 3/4\\}$. These are known as **phase-shifted X gates** or **phase-shifted Z gates** and are chosen to avoid classical simulation shortcuts (like Clifford gates).\n",
    "- Final Layer: A final layer of single-qubit gates followed by measurement in a basis determined by the client."
